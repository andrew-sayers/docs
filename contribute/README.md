# Contribute to the Sleep Diary Project

We are an open source project helping people to understand their sleeping patterns.  Take a look at [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/sleepdiary/).

If you just want to report a problem or suggest a small change, [file an issue](https://github.com/sleepdiary/conference-room/issues/new/choose) and we'll take a look.

But if you want to really dig in to the project, take a look at [suggested first issues](https://github.com/sleepdiary/conference-room/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) or dive right in by [making a development environment](dev-environment).
