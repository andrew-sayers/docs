# Contribute to the Sleep Diary Project

We are an open source project helping people to understand their sleeping patterns.  Take a look at [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/sleepdiary/).

If you just want to report a problem or suggest a small change, [file an issue](https://github.com/sleepdiary/sleepdiary.github.io/issues/new/choose) and we'll take a look.

But if you want to really dig in to the project, [make a development environment](dev-environment) and get started.
