# Contribute to the Sleep Diary Project

The Sleep Diary Project's mission is *to remove technical barriers to the study and improvement of sleep*.  Work is organised through [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/sleepdiary/), and primarily involves creating open source software and information.

If you'd like to report a problem or suggest a small change, [file an issue](https://github.com/sleepdiary/conference-room/issues/new/choose) and we'll take a look.

If you want to get involved, take a look at [suggested first issues](https://github.com/sleepdiary/conference-room/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) or dive right in by [making a development environment](dev-environment).
