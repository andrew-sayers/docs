This section of the wiki discusses common patterns of sleep, and how to manage them.

[The dashboard](https://sleepdiary.github.io/dashboard/) tries to detect some patterns automatically.  The algorithm it uses is available in [patterns.js](https://github.com/sleepdiary/info/blob/main/src/patterns.js).

## General information

It can be useful to simulate different sleeping patterns to compare to your own.  For a simple introduction, see [simulate different patterns](simulate).

People who sleep at unusual times often have to deal with sleeping in a sunlit room.  For help dealing with this, see [block out sunlight](sunlight).
