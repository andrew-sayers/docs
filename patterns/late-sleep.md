# Do you have trouble getting to sleep on time?

Some people like to wake up early (sometimes called &ldquo;[larks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark_(person))&rdquo;), others prefer to work late into the night (sometimes called &ldquo;[night owls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl_(person))&rdquo;).  A lot of people have trouble getting to bed on time, and this page discusses some issues faced by people with unusually late nights.

Some people manage to identify specific issues that disrupt their sleep, like drinking coffee in the evening.  But many people find it's just the way their body works.

A specialist sleep doctor may be able to help, and will usually ask you to [keep a sleep diary](creating) for at least two weeks prior to your appointment.

[Vitamin D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D) is an important compound for health, which you naturally make when your skin is exposed to the sun.  If you tend to sleep late, and to spend daylight hours indoors, you might need to get it from foods or supplements instead.  This also depends on your lifestyle and the country you live in, so you should look for advice in your country (or from your doctor).  For example, the UK isn't a particularly sunny country and [the NHS advice on vitamin D](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/) mentions sunlight exposure as one of many variables to consider.
