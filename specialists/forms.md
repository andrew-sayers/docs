This page compares forms and reports used in the real world, to give give you some idea about the process of analysing sleep.  This page is intended for people interested in designing their own forms - see [the list of specialists](./) if you're looking for treatment.

## Forms

<SortableTable :columns="forms_reports_columns" :rows="forms_rows" />

## Reports

<SortableTable :columns="forms_reports_columns" :rows="reports_rows" />

## Events

An &ldquo;event&rdquo; is anything that happens during a day, which someone might think is relevant to your sleep.  Diaries can ask people to fill out different events, and can use different symbols to represent them.  The table below summarises all known events.

<SortableTable :columns="events_columns" :rows="events_rows" />
