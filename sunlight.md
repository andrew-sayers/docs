# Blocking out sunlight

Minimising the amount of sunlight in your room can drastically improve your quality and quantity of sleep.  The image on the right shows three light barriers, which combine to block out almost all light.

__First barrier: hard sheets of material__.  This blocks out most of the light, but can leave gaps for light to get through.  This can be as simple as some old cardboard boxes, but you might find they leave too many slivers of light.  Proper cardboard sheets are cheap and available online.  Other materials work fine (like the hardboard shown in the images), but tend to be more expensive for no real benefit.

__Second barrier: heavy fabric__.  This covers the gaps from the first barrier, and should be more pleasant to look at.  The fabric needs to be held up by a long pole (preferably a pull-up bar, like you would use for exercising).  A thick blanket should work fine, but you can buy heavy-weight fabrics online if you prefer.  Be aware that areas exposed to light will gradually be bleached by the sun, as shown in the image below.

__Final barrier: curtains__.  These block a little bit of remaining light, but their main role is to encourage sleep by making the space feel more like a bedroom.

## Strengths and weaknesses

This solution almost eliminates sunlight from a room, which can make it feel like a sleeping space even on a bright summer day.

One important weakness of this solution is that it can be difficult to see your window at all.  As well as not seeing out of the window, you're less likely to notice problems like mould.  You should try to take the barriers down regularly, to clean the fabric and wash the windows.  Depending on your location, you might need to do this as much as once a month or as little as once a year.

Another important weakness is that the pull-up bar will probably fall down once every few years.  The fabric should soften the bar's fall, and the curtain should stop the sheets from falling, so this is usually a minor disruption to your night's sleep.  You can just reset the barriers when you wake up.

A secondary strength of this solution is that it can help manage the temperature in your bedroom.  Open your bedroom door and windows at night to let cool air in, then close them before dawn to stop warm air from coming in, and reset the barriers to stop the sun from heating up the room.  You should find your room is several degrees cooler even if your primary sleep is in the mid-afternoon.
